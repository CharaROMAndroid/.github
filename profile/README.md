## 📱 About CharaROM

CharaROM is a custom Android ROM based on LineageOS (with features of other ROMs), designed with a focus on **security, stability, performance, and user control**. It delivers a clean Android experience enhanced by thoughtful features that improve everyday usability—without compromising reliability.

The goal is simple:

> ⚡ **Fast system**  
> 🧱 **Reliable behavior**  
> 🎛️ **Full user choice**

### 🧩 Why the name *CharaROM*?

The name *CharaROM* has a dual meaning.

Part of the inspiration comes from *Undertale*, where the character Chara is associated with themes of chaos, control, and consequence. More importantly, however, **Chara is the lead developer’s chosen non-binary name**, and this project reflects their personal values and design philosophy.

Some features in CharaROM are lightly inspired by the *chara*cter conceptually—but this project is **not affiliated with Toby Fox, Undertale, or Deltarune** in any way.

## 🎛️ Customization without compromise

Like crDroid, CharaROM emphasizes **consistency across devices** while allowing deep system customization. Nearly every major UI component can be tailored to your preferences, including:

- Status bar  
- Quick settings  
- Navigation & gestures  
- Lockscreen  
- System theming  

**Your device. Your rules.**

## 🚀 Performance-first philosophy

> **Performance matters.**

CharaROM avoids aggressive or gimmicky optimizations that harm stability or battery life.  
The system stays smooth, responsive, and predictable—because reliability is a feature.

- Balanced battery usage  
- Fluid animations  
- No unnecessary background hacks  

---

## 🔐 Security you can trust

> **Security stays current.**

CharaROM closely tracks AOSP and regularly incorporates recent Android security patches.  
Open development ensures changes can be reviewed, audited, and improved by the community.

---

## 🌍 Open source & community-driven

> **CharaROM is fully open source.**

All development happens transparently.  
Maintainers, contributors, and users collaborate in the open to improve the project.

If you want control without sacrificing stability or security, **CharaROM is built for you**.

## ⚠️ Important warning — please read

> **Flashing custom ROMs carries risk.**

Some Android ROMs—such as **closed-source projects or ROMs maintained by developers banned from major Android communities**—cannot be independently audited.

Additionally, some projects fail to properly attribute upstream sources, which harms the open-source ecosystem and undermines trust.

> ❌ **Closed-source ROMs cannot be verified**

Without source code access, you cannot confirm what is running on your device. This increases the risk of:

- Malware  
- Data leaks  
- Unauthorized access to personal information  

**Bottom line:**
- ✅ Prefer **open-source ROMs and FOSS applications**
- ✅ Review the source code
- ✅ Check maintainer history
- ✅ Evaluate community trust
- ✅ Allow the user to do what they want, not block mods via unneccessary means.

Flashing blindly is how devices get compromised.
